# 🧪 TB-SERS Analyzer

**This Python-based tool is designed for blood plasma analysis, enabling rapid and cost-effective testing using Raman spectroscopy (RS) and Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). It specifically analyzes RS/SERS spectra and has demonstrated a high level of agreement with results obtained from the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). By integrating RS/SERS techniques with machine learning (ML) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), the software provides quick analysis—with an average processing time of less than ten seconds. Coupled with its reporting module, this makes it a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for tuberculosis (TB) screening.**

## 🖥️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkeisiri/TB-SERS-Analyzer.git
cd TB-SERS-Analyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

After installing dependencies, run the application:

```bash
python TB-SERS-Analyzer.py
```

## 🛠️ Creating Executable with PyInstaller

If you want to create a standalone executable for **TB-SERS Analyzer** using **PyInstaller**, follow the steps below.

### 1. Install PyInstaller

First, install **PyInstaller** if you haven’t already:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Create `.spec` File with PyInstaller

Once **PyInstaller** is installed, you can generate the `.spec` file by running:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed TB-SERS-Analyzer.py
```

Explanation of flags:

- `--onefile` creates a single executable file
- `--windowed` suppresses the terminal window when running the app (ideal for GUI apps)

This will create a `.spec` file in the project directory.

### 3. Customize `.spec` File

If you need to bundle additional files (e.g., the trained model file `.h5`), open the generated `.spec` file and modify the `datas` section. For example:

```python
datas=[('database/', 'database'),('css/', 'css'),('icon/', 'icon'),('generate/', 'generate'),('requirements.txt', '.')]
```

This will ensure that the necessary files are included in the generated executable.

### 4. Build the Executable

Now, use the `.spec` file to build the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller TB-SERS-Analyzer.spec
```

This will generate the standalone executable in the `dist/` folder.

---

### 5. Result
After the build process is complete, you will find the executable in the `dist/` folder. You can now run the application without needing Python installed on the system.
